## About project

Short description of functionality:

The aim of the project is to create an application that will allow you to handle the basic activities undertaken when renting a hotel room. It is intended for use by hotel employees. The user of the application will be able to create an account thanks to which his data will be placed in the database created for the project. This action will allow you to choose the right room for the guest, select its parameters, e.g. the number of places for guests, equipment, view, standard, parking space added to the room price, etc., and choose the appropriate price. There will also be a choice of meals from the hotel's restaurant. It will be possible to book well in advance with the specific date of arrival and departure as well as immediate rental. The application will collect data from a given period of time (e.g. annual, quarterly) regarding the number of guests, revenues, etc.
